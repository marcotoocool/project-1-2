    <p>Hello my name is marco, ive currently been at el camino for 2 years now, im currently studying for my CIS degree. Besides that i really enjoy trying out different foods and doing things with friends or having time alone. Im kind of someone who doesnt like talking alot but im always wanting to have conversations with people as its something i really enjoy. Some other things i really enjoy are gaming or listening to music, i dont really like very complex games i prefer much more simple games. Other than that i have many interest some more than others i spend alot of my free time trying to study for things but just end up getting sidetracked.</p>
